## Getting Started

Dolphin is a serverless web application built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

To run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
